# Voyant

Voyant is a source-available framework for travel companies. It provides starter apps and domain modules for CRM, products, availability, bookings, finance, distribution, resources, legal, and related travel workflows.

#### [CLI](./packages/cli/README.md) | [DMC Template](./templates/dmc/README.md) | [Operator Template](./templates/operator/README.md) | [Packages](./packages) | [Examples](./examples)

## Get started

### 1. Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @voyantjs/cli
```

You can also use `pnpm add -g @voyantjs/cli`.

### 2. Scaffold a project from a starter

```bash
voyant new my-travel-app --template dmc
cd my-travel-app
pnpm install
```

Built-in starters are downloaded from the matching GitHub Release for your installed CLI version.

You can also point `--template` at a custom local starter directory.

### 3. Configure the app

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
```

Then set your secrets in `.dev.vars` and provide `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` for Drizzle and local worker processes.

### 4. Run the app

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev
```

If your starter uses background jobs, run the worker in a second terminal:

```bash
pnpm dev:worker
```

## Starter templates

Voyant currently ships two first-party starters:

| Starter | Purpose | Stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`templates/dmc`](./templates/dmc/README.md) | Destination management company workflows | Cloudflare Workers, TanStack Start, Hono, Better Auth, Drizzle, Hatchet |
| [`templates/operator`](./templates/operator/README.md) | Tour operator workflows | Cloudflare Workers, TanStack Start, Hono, Better Auth, Drizzle, Hatchet |

## What you get

- A deployable application shell, not just isolated packages
- A normalized travel operations data model on PostgreSQL + Drizzle
- Headless domain modules for CRM, catalog, availability, bookings, finance, legal, resources, and more
- Hono-based API transport with optional Next.js route helpers
- Better Auth wiring in first-party starters, while keeping core packages auth-provider agnostic
- Optional integrations for payments, invoicing, storage, CMS sync, and notifications

## For contributors

This repository is the workspace that powers the framework, starters, and examples.

| Area | What it contains |
| --- | --- |
| [`packages/*`](./packages) | Reusable business logic, schemas, services, transport adapters, and integrations |
| [`templates/*`](./templates) | First-party starter apps |
| [`apps/dev`](./apps/dev/README.md) | Internal playground for broader module coverage |
| [`apps/registry`](./apps/registry) | Hosted shadcn registry for installable Voyant UI components |
| [`examples/*`](./examples) | Reference apps that consume Voyant surfaces |

### Monorepo commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm install` | Install workspace dependencies |
| `pnpm build` | Build the workspace with Turborepo |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Run workspace typechecks |
| `pnpm test` | Run workspace tests |
| `pnpm lint` | Run Biome checks across the repo |
| `pnpm -F dmc dev` | Start the DMC template on port `3100` |
| `pnpm -F operator dev` | Start the operator template on port `3300` |
| `pnpm -F dev dev` | Start the internal playground on port `3200` |

## Architecture

Voyant keeps a strict boundary:

- `packages/*` hold reusable business logic, schemas, services, routes, adapters, and contracts
- `templates/*` and app shells own UI, auth wiring, deployment shape, and runtime-specific configuration
- Core packages stay framework-agnostic even when first-party starters use React, TanStack Start, Hono, Better Auth, and Cloudflare Workers
- Transport adapters stay thin and call shared domain services rather than owning business logic
