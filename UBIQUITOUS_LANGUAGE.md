## Relationships (the domain laws)

- A **Person** may belong to zero or more **Organizations**; both can appear on Bookings and Orders.
- An **Opportunity** belongs to one Person and/or Organization; produces zero or more **Quotes**.
- A **Quote** is informational; an **Offer** is the transactable equivalent — a Quote does not become an Offer automatically.
- An **Offer** converts to exactly one **Order**; an Order may be created without a prior Offer (direct booking).
- An **Order** produces one or more **Bookings**; a Booking is the fulfillment side of one Order.
- A **Booking** holds **Allocations** against **Slots** (or Pickups, or Resources); each Allocation belongs to exactly one Booking Item.
- A **Booking Item** produces zero or more **Fulfillments**; each Fulfillment is delivered over exactly one channel.
- An **Order** produces one or more **Invoices**; an Invoice belongs to exactly one Order (and may reference its Booking).
- A **Payment Schedule** belongs to a Booking; each schedule line resolves via a **Payment Session** to one or more **Payments**.
- A **Channel** sells via an **Allotment** (its reserved inventory) and earns via **Commission Rules**; **Settlement** runs reconcile its activity.
- A **Policy** is assigned by scope (Product, Channel, Market, Booking); a **Policy Acceptance** binds a specific Policy Version to a Person or Booking.
- **Cost** ≠ **Rate** ≠ **Price**: Cost is what we pay, Rate is the Supplier's per-unit tariff input, Price is what the customer sees.

## Example dialogue

> **Sales agent:** "I've got a hot **Opportunity** with the Henderson family — eight **Travelers**, two weeks in Egypt. I sent them a **Quote** last week."

> **Operations manager:** "Good. If they're ready to commit, build them an **Offer** — that pulls live **Sellability** for the dates and locks the **Cost** from our Cairo **Suppliers**. Once they accept, it converts to an **Order**."

> **Sales agent:** "And the **Booking** is created from the **Order**?"

> **Operations manager:** "Yes — the Order is the commercial commitment with the **Order Terms** they have to accept. The **Booking** is operational: it holds **Allocations** against the **Slots** for each guided day, books a **Stay** at the **Property** in Aswan, and sets up **Dispatches** with **Vehicles** and **Drivers** for the transfers."

> **Sales agent:** "What about the cancellation thing they asked about?"

> **Operations manager:** "That's the **Cancellation Policy** assigned to the Product. We'll record a **Policy Acceptance** against the specific **Policy Version** when they sign the **Contract**. If they later cancel, we **Cancel** the Booking — that's an operational reversal — and **Void** any Invoices that were never paid. If they paid, we issue a **Credit Note** instead."

> **Finance:** "Don't forget the **Payment Schedule**. Deposit at booking, balance 30 days out. The deposit is also our **Guarantee**. Each line goes through a **Payment Session** when collected."

> **Sales agent:** "Got it. And if Expedia sends us this same booking instead of direct?"

> **Operations manager:** "Then it comes in via that **Channel** under their **Allotment**, the **Commission Rule** computes their cut, and it shows up in next month's **Settlement** run for **Reconciliation**."

## Flagged ambiguities

These terms are used loosely in conversation. Pick the canonical form below; treat the rest as smells when you see them in code or docs.

- **Customer / client / buyer** — none are first-class entities. The canonical CRM record is **Person** (with optional **Organization**). On a Booking, the buyer is captured as `personId` + `organizationId` snapshot fields. Avoid "customer" / "client" except in UI copy facing the operator's own staff.
- **Tour / trip / experience / package** — all collapse to **Product**. The booking shape is encoded in `productBookingMode` (`date`, `date-time`, `open`, `stay`, `transfer`, `itinerary`).
- **Quote vs. Offer** — both look like "a price proposal". **Quote** is a CRM artifact attached to an Opportunity (informational, pre-sales). **Offer** is the transactional, sellability-resolved, sendable, acceptable document on the commitment ladder. They are not synonyms.
- **Order vs. Booking** — both are post-sale. **Order** is the commercial commitment (with Order Terms, links to Invoices); **Booking** is the operational record (Travelers, Allocations, Fulfillments). One Order produces one Booking in normal flows; do not use them interchangeably.
- **Reservation** — overloaded between "Hold" (a temporary inventory claim) and "Booking" (the persistent record). Use **Hold** or **Booking** — never "Reservation".
- **Cancel vs. Void vs. Close** — different verbs for different domains. **Cancel** = operational reversal (Booking, Order, Allocation). **Void** = financial reversal (Invoice, Payment). **Close** = end an Opportunity with an outcome. Don't blend them.
- **Hold vs. Allocation vs. Reservation** — **Hold** is the temporal status of a Booking before confirmation (`hold_expires_at`). **Allocation** is the inventory-line entity (`held` → `confirmed` → `fulfilled`). Avoid "Reservation".
- **Supplier vs. Partner vs. Provider** — **Supplier** is the entity that sells us services. **Partner** is a relationship type on Organizations. **Provider** is for tech integrations (notification provider, storage provider) — do not call a hotel a "provider".
- **Channel vs. Distribution vs. Partner** — **Channel** is the entity (the OTA, the affiliate, the marketplace). **Distribution** is the subdomain. Don't say "Partner" when you mean Channel.
- **Contact** — too overloaded to use raw. Pick: **Person** (CRM record), **Contact Point** (email/phone/website on identity), **Named Contact** (titled role at an Organization), or **Participant** (role on a deal/order/booking).
- **Traveler vs. Participant vs. Guest** — **Traveler** is the person actually traveling (booking_travelers, with category and PII). **Participant** is the broader role-bearer on a transaction (booker, decision-maker, finance, traveler). Avoid "Guest" except inside hospitality where it specifically means a Traveler occupying a room.
- **Capacity** is always a number, never a status. Slots have a capacity *and* a status — don't conflate them.
- **Cost / Rate / Price** — three distinct money concepts. **Cost** = our outflow to a Supplier. **Rate** = the Supplier's per-unit tariff (per_person, per_night, etc.). **Price** = what the customer pays. Never use them interchangeably even when numerically equal.
- **Issue vs. Fulfill vs. Deliver** — **Issue** = produce the artifact (Fulfillment, Invoice, Contract). **Fulfill** = mark operational completion of a Booking Item or Allocation. **Deliver** = transmit an issued artifact over a channel (email, download, wallet, API). Three steps, not synonyms.
