# Voyant Admin Architecture

This guide defines how Voyant should treat the admin surface as a shared runtime
and extension boundary.

The goal is simple:

- keep the admin shell and runtime shared
- make extension points explicit instead of ad hoc
- keep UI blocks, runtime hooks, and admin extensions as separate layers
- support admin localization without confusing it for business-content
  translation

The admin should be a first-class framework surface, not just template-local UI.

## Core Rules

### 1. Keep the admin shell and runtime shared

Voyant should keep a shared admin runtime layer for:

- shared providers
- auth-aware admin context
- locale/timezone runtime
- base layout primitives and shared admin concerns

That shared layer should live in the common admin/runtime packages rather than
being reimplemented in each template.

Rule:

The admin runtime should be framework-owned even when the final shell/layout is
template-owned.

### 2. Keep the final admin shell template-owned

Starter templates should still own:

- the final admin shell composition
- overall layout decisions
- product-specific navigation defaults
- app-owned route composition

This keeps Voyant flexible without making the admin surface unstructured.

Rule:

Voyant should own the shared admin runtime and extension seams, while templates
own the final shell and composition.

## Extension Surface

### 3. Make admin extension points explicit

The admin should expose stable extension points such as:

- admin UI routes
- navigation contributions
- widget or injection slots
- detail-panel or summary-card contributions where appropriate

These should be treated as first-class extension seams, not as informal app
patch points.

Rule:

Admin customization should happen through explicit extension points before full
route/shell override.

### 4. Admin UI routes are part of the extension model

Modules, extensions, or app-owned code may need dedicated admin pages.

Those should plug into the admin surface as a recognized route class rather than
feeling like unrelated template-local pages.

Rule:

Admin pages contributed by packages should be treated as a supported extension
surface.

### 5. Navigation contributions should stay narrow and predictable

The admin should allow packages to contribute navigation entries without
turning navigation into an opaque runtime registry.

Navigation contributions should stay:

- typed
- explicit
- predictable in placement and labeling

Rule:

Navigation contribution is an admin extension seam, not a generic dynamic menu
system.

### 6. Widgets and injection zones should be selective

Not every admin screen should be endlessly injectable.

Voyant should expose widget/injection zones only where extensibility is
genuinely useful, such as:

- booking detail side panels
- finance summary cards
- legal/document action areas
- product detail operational add-ons

Rule:

Admin widget slots should be intentional and few, not everywhere by default.

## UI Layering

### 7. Keep runtime hooks and source-installed UI blocks separate

Voyant already has complementary frontend layers:

- shared React/runtime packages
- source-installed UI blocks and registry components
- admin extension points

These are not competing ideas.

The layering should be:

- admin extension surface decides where UI may attach
- shared runtime packages provide hooks/providers and admin context
- source-installed UI blocks provide editable presentation building blocks

Rule:

Do not replace source-installed UI blocks with the admin extension surface, and
do not use blocks as a substitute for explicit admin extension points.

### 8. Preserve the source-installed UI strategy

Voyant should keep:

- `@voyantjs/*-react`
- `@voyantjs/voyant-admin`
- the registry/source-installed UI approach

That strategy gives teams editable UI while the framework still owns the runtime
and extension contracts.

Rule:

Editable UI blocks are part of the frontend strategy and should remain
complementary to admin extension points.

## Localization

### 9. Separate admin UI locale from business-content locale

Admin UI language is not the same thing as product or content translation.

Examples:

- admin labels, actions, and navigation are UI locale concerns
- product titles, descriptions, and contract copy are business-content concerns

A Romanian customer may want the admin UI in Romanian while still managing
English or German travel content.

Rule:

Admin UI localization and business-content localization must stay separate.

### 10. Use a clear admin locale resolution order

The admin locale should resolve through a simple preference hierarchy:

1. explicit user override
2. organization default admin locale
3. browser language on first sign-in
4. fallback to `en`

This keeps the model simple while supporting mixed-language teams.

Rule:

Admin locale resolution should prefer user choice first, then organization
default, then browser-derived bootstrap, then English fallback.

### 11. Locale formatting should include timezone-aware presentation

Admin locale/runtime should drive:

- text translations
- date formatting
- time formatting
- number and currency formatting

Timezone should remain user-driven where appropriate.

Rule:

Admin localization should include formatting/runtime concerns, not just string
translation.

## Practical Checklist

When adding or reviewing an admin capability in Voyant:

1. Decide whether it belongs in the shared admin runtime or the template-owned
   shell.
2. Prefer explicit admin UI routes, nav contributions, or widget slots over
   shell patching.
3. Keep the extension point narrow and typed.
4. Use shared runtime hooks/providers instead of duplicating admin context.
5. Keep source-installed UI blocks as the editable presentation layer.
6. Treat admin UI locale separately from business-content translation.
7. Resolve admin locale through user override, org default, browser bootstrap,
   then English fallback.

## Non-Goals

This guide does not introduce:

- a fully closed admin product
- a giant plugin runtime for admin UI
- a replacement for the source-installed UI strategy

The point is a clear shared admin runtime and extension surface, not a more
rigid dashboard framework.
