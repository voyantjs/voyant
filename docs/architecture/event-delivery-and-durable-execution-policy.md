# Voyant Event Delivery And Durable Execution Policy

This guide defines how Voyant should treat emitted events, subscribers, and the
boundary between fire-and-forget signaling and durable background execution.

It extends:

- [`execution-architecture.md`](./execution-architecture.md)
- [`notifications-architecture.md`](./notifications-architecture.md)

The goal is narrow:

- standardize the event envelope and event taxonomy that Voyant already uses
- keep ordinary event delivery honest about its in-process semantics
- separate event emission from durable queued execution
- defer event priority until durable queued delivery exists for a concrete event
  family

Voyant should standardize event shape now. It should not pretend that the
current event bus is already a durable queue.

## Core Rules

### 1. Keep one standard event envelope

Voyant event consumers should share one canonical envelope shape.

The current baseline already exists in [`@voyantjs/core/events`](../../packages/core/src/events.ts):

- `name`
- `data`
- `metadata`
- `emittedAt`

Metadata should keep using the existing fields where relevant:

- `category` (`domain` or `internal`)
- `source` (`workflow`, `service`, `route`, `subscriber`, `system`)
- correlation or causation identifiers when useful

Rule:

Use the shared core event envelope instead of inventing package-local event
shapes.

### 2. Distinguish domain events from internal events

Not every emitted event has the same audience.

Use `domain` for business milestones that other modules or integrations may
reasonably care about.

Examples:

- `invoice.settled`
- `booking.documents.sent`
- `product.created`

Use `internal` for process signals that are still useful to subscribers,
diagnostics, or automation, but are not part of the core business language.

Examples:

- `invoice.document.generated`
- `contract.document.generated`

Rule:

Choose event category intentionally so consumers can tell whether the event is a
business fact or an internal process signal.

### 3. Treat the current event bus as in-process fire-and-forget delivery

The current default `EventBus` implementation in
[`@voyantjs/core/events`](../../packages/core/src/events.ts) is in-process.

Its semantics are explicit:

- handlers run sequentially
- subscriber errors are caught and logged
- subscribers do not affect the emitter outcome
- emission does not imply durable delivery or retry

Rule:

Do not describe the current event bus as a queue, a durable stream, or a
reliable delivery mechanism.

### 4. Emit events after the durable state change they describe

An event should normally describe a business or process fact that is already
true in durable storage.

Good examples:

- generate a document, persist the rendition or attachment, then emit the
  generated event
- reconcile a settlement, persist the payment and invoice updates, then emit the
  settled event
- send the booking documents, persist the delivery row, then emit the sent event

Rule:

Emit the event after the durable state transition it describes, not before.

### 5. Subscribers are observers, not part of the correctness boundary

Subscribers are a good fit for:

- secondary sync reactions
- notifications and follow-up reactions
- cache invalidation or read-model refresh requests
- diagnostics and logging

They are not a good fit for correctness-critical work that must succeed before
the caller can treat the main operation as complete.

Rule:

If the side effect is part of the correctness boundary, do not hide it in a
fire-and-forget subscriber.

### 6. Use durable jobs or workflows for retryable background execution

When a side effect needs:

- retries
- durable execution
- delayed execution
- explicit job identity or idempotency
- queue-backed isolation from the request path

it should move to the `JobRunner` / workflow side, not stay on the plain event
bus.

Voyant already has the right boundary for this in
[`@voyantjs/core/orchestration`](../../packages/core/src/orchestration.ts) and
[`@voyantjs/core/workflows`](../../packages/core/src/workflows.ts).

Rule:

Use events for signaling. Use jobs or workflows for durable background work.

### 7. Do not promise queue semantics through EventBus adapters implicitly

The `EventBus` interface may be implemented by templates or adapters in
runtime-specific ways, but the portable contract should remain honest.

That means callers should not assume:

- durable retries
- ordering beyond the implementation's explicit behavior
- dead-letter handling
- backpressure controls
- priority

unless the runtime-specific event family documents those semantics clearly.

Rule:

Do not smuggle queue guarantees into the generic `EventBus` contract.

### 8. Introduce durable queue-backed delivery one event family at a time

If a future event family needs stronger guarantees, add them narrowly.

A good first promotion would look like:

- one concrete event family
- one durable execution path
- explicit runtime-specific guarantees
- clear ownership for retries, failure handling, and idempotency

Rule:

Promote durable delivery family by family, not by turning every event into a
queue message at once.

### 9. Defer event priority until durable queued delivery exists

Priority only matters once there is a real queued execution surface where work
competes for runtime capacity.

Without durable queued execution, priority is just metadata with no honest
behavior behind it.

Rule:

Do not add event priority until one durable queue-backed event family exists and
proves the need.

## Review Heuristics

When reviewing event-related changes:

1. Is this event describing a fact that is already durable?
2. Is the event `domain` or `internal`?
3. Can subscriber failure be tolerated without breaking correctness?
4. Does this side effect actually need durable retries or scheduled execution?
5. Is a queue-backed path being proposed for one real event family, or as a
   premature framework-wide abstraction?

## Audit Examples

The purpose of this section is to anchor policy in current Voyant code rather
than in generic messaging folklore.

### 10. Invoice document generation: internal event after the rendition exists

Write path:

- [`financeDocumentService.generateInvoiceDocument(...)`](../../packages/finance/src/service-documents.ts)
  creates or updates the invoice rendition first
- only then does it emit `invoice.document.generated`
- the event is emitted with `category: "internal"` and `source: "service"`

Policy outcome:

- this is the correct pattern for process signals
- the event describes completed document generation state
- subscriber failure should not roll back the underlying document record

### 11. Invoice settlement: domain event after payment state is durable

Write path:

- [`financeSettlementService.reconcileSettlement(...)`](../../packages/finance/src/service-settlement.ts)
  creates the payment and updates invoice state first
- only then does it emit `invoice.settled`
- the event is emitted with `category: "domain"` and `source: "service"`

Policy outcome:

- this is a good example of a business milestone event
- the event is a signal to downstream observers, not the mechanism that makes
  the invoice settled
- if follow-up reactions ever need durable retries, they should move onto a job
  or workflow path rather than changing the event bus contract globally

### 12. Booking document sends: delivery row first, event second

Write path:

- [`bookingDocumentNotificationService.sendBookingDocuments(...)`](../../packages/notifications/src/service-booking-documents.ts)
  persists the delivery request first
- only then does it emit `booking.documents.sent`

Policy outcome:

- this is the right event ordering
- the event announces a durable delivery request/result record, not a mere
  intent to try later

### 13. CMS sync subscribers: fire-and-forget observers are appropriate here

Subscriber paths:

- [`payloadCmsPlugin(...)`](../../packages/plugins/payload-cms/src/plugin.ts)
  subscribes to `product.created`, `product.updated`, and `product.deleted`
- [`sanityCmsPlugin(...)`](../../packages/plugins/sanity-cms/src/plugin.ts)
  does the same
- both catch and log subscriber failures instead of trying to alter the emitter
  result

Policy outcome:

- these integrations are good fits for the current fire-and-forget subscriber
  model
- subscriber errors are operational issues, not reasons to invalidate the core
  product write
- if a deployment eventually needs durable content-sync guarantees, that should
  be introduced as a dedicated durable execution path for that event family

## Practical Checklist

When adding or reviewing event behavior in Voyant:

1. Use the shared event envelope from `@voyantjs/core/events`.
2. Mark the event as `domain` or `internal` intentionally.
3. Emit the event after the durable state change it describes.
4. Keep subscriber work outside the correctness boundary.
5. Move retryable or delayed side effects to `JobRunner` or workflows.
6. Introduce queue-backed delivery only for one justified event family at a
   time.
7. Do not add priority metadata until durable queued delivery exists and uses
   it honestly.

## Non-Goals

This guide does not introduce:

- a universal durable event bus
- queue semantics hidden behind the generic `EventBus` contract
- event priority as a framework-wide feature today

The point is a clean and honest event model, not a premature messaging
platform.
