# @voyantjs/finance-react

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8566f2d: Add a booking-scoped public finance document surface for invoice and proforma
  downloads.

  `@voyantjs/finance` now exposes a public booking documents route that returns
  customer-safe invoice and proforma document metadata, including the best
  available rendition status and download URL when a ready rendition has a public
  or signed URL. `@voyantjs/finance-react` now exposes matching schemas, query
  keys, query options, operations, and a `usePublicBookingDocuments` hook.

- 8566f2d: Republish the public storefront package surfaces so published tarballs match the
  current source tree. This release restores the public finance schemas needed by
  `@voyantjs/finance-react`, publishes the public booking and product service
  exports already present in source, and ships the day/version/media product React
  exports from the package root.
